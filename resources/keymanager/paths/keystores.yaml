  operationId: KEYMANAGER_IMPORT
  summary: Import Keystore.
  description: |
    Import a single BLS keystore conforming to version 4 of [EIP-2335: BLS12-381 Keystore](https://eips.ethlibrary.io/eip-2335.html). The keystore's password is encrypted via ECIES with the `encrypting_pk_hex` ETH SECP256K1 public key that is safeguarded within the enclave, producing `ct_password`. It is expected that the user first have Secure-Signer perform remote attestation with `encrypting_pk_hex` to gain trust.

    The `slashing_protection` follows the [EIP-3076: Slashing Protection Interchange Format](https://eips.ethlibrary.io/eip-3076.html), which may store the signing histories of multiple BLS keys. Currently Secure-Signer only supports importing a single key at a time. This limitation means only the 0th indexed key will be imported: `slashing_protection["data"][0]`. If 
    this `slashing_protection["data"][0]["pubkey"]` does not match the pubkey decrypted from the keystore, the import will fail. If no `slashing_protection` is supplied, an empty one will be initialized starting from `slot=0`, `source_epoch=0`, and `target_epoch=0`.
