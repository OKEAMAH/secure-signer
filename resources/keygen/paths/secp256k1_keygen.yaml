  operationId: ETH_KEYGEN
  summary: Generate ETH Key.
  description: |
    Generates a fresh ETH (SECP256K1) keypair within Secure-Signer. Returns the hex-encoded ETH public key for the private ETH key that was generated in Secure-Signer. The 33-Byte compressed ETH public key is committed to in a remote attestation report, and the resulting remote attestation evidence is also returned. The `evidence` should be verified before trusting the ETH key, which is used to encrypt a BLS keystore password during importing.
